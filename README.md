# Survivor-Voting-Association

The CBS show survivor uses a voting system to determine who is eliminated each week. Each player has one vote each tribal they attend. There are, of course, many exceptions. With tied votes, a re-vote may occur where the targets of the tied are not allowed to vote and the other tribe members can only vote for them.
